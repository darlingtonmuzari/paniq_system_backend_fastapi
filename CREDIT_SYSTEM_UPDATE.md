# Credit System Update - Product Creation vs Subscription

## Problem
Previously, firms were required to have credits upfront when creating subscription products, which was causing HTTP 402 errors when firms had zero credit balance.

## Solution
Updated the credit system to follow a more logical flow:

### Before (Old Behavior)
1. **Product Creation**: Required credits upfront
   - Firm needed credits to create products
   - Credits were deducted immediately upon product creation
   - This prevented firms from creating products if they had no credits

2. **User Subscription**: No credit deduction
   - Users could subscribe to products without affecting firm credits

### After (New Behavior)
1. **Product Creation**: No credits required
   - Firms can create products without having credits
   - No credits are deducted during product creation
   - Products are created immediately and become available

2. **User Subscription**: Credits deducted from firm
   - When a user subscribes to a product, credits are deducted from the firm's balance
   - Firm must have sufficient credits for the subscription to succeed
   - If firm has insufficient credits, the subscription fails with HTTP 402

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `SubscriptionService.create_product()`
- Removed credit balance check
- Removed credit deduction
- Updated documentation to reflect new behavior

### 2. Updated `SubscriptionService.purchase_subscription()`
- Added credit balance check for the firm
- Added credit deduction when user subscribes
- Credits are deducted using the product's `credit_cost` value

### 3. Updated API Documentation
- Updated `ProductCreateRequest` description for `credit_cost` field
- Updated endpoint documentation to clarify new behavior

## Benefits

1. **Easier Product Creation**: Firms can create products without needing credits upfront
2. **Pay-per-Use Model**: Firms only pay credits when their products are actually used
3. **Better Cash Flow**: Firms don't need to invest credits before seeing any returns
4. **Logical Flow**: Credits are deducted when value is delivered (user subscription)

## Testing Results

✅ **Product Creation**: Successfully created multiple products with zero firm credits
✅ **Product Listing**: Products appear correctly in firm's product list
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints working correctly with new logic

## API Endpoints Affected

- `POST /api/v1/subscription-products/` - No longer requires credits
- `GET /api/v1/subscription-products/my-products` - Works correctly with new products
- User subscription endpoints will now deduct credits from firms

## Example Usage

```bash
# Create a product (no credits required)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/subscription-products/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Basic Security Package",
    "description": "Standard monitoring service",
    "max_users": 10,
    "price": 199.99,
    "credit_cost": 25
  }'

# Response: 200 OK (product created successfully)
```

The `credit_cost` field now represents the credits that will be deducted from the firm when users subscribe to this product, not the credits required to create the product.
